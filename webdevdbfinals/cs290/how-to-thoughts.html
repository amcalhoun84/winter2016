<h1>That's All Folks!</h1>

<p>Well, here we are at the end. I hope this guide helped clear up how to do some of the basic functions of the Maps API. Though Google has an amazing and robust documentation for its various APIs, they can be a bit arcane and can leave out important details for beginning developers, plus the information is often scattered throughout the documentation. It is a lot to take in, but the Maps API is incredibly robust, even on its most basic levels. I actually had a lot of fun writing this how-to, and let's see what happens when we tie it all together!</p>

<p>Once you get the hang of the basics of Maps and are a little more comfortable with the API, I recommend looking into topics like <strong>Geocoding</strong>, mastering the <strong>Directions</strong> portion of the API, and looking into the <strong>customizable 45&deg; view</strong>. Once you get that down, you can also move onto the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/javascript/" target="_blank">Google Places API</a>, which is an excellent API for businesses and other organizations that I highly recommend. It is excellent for helping improve traffic flow to your business and even some search engine optimizers and web developers believe it can improve web traffic to your website.</p> 

<p>If you are feeling particularly daring, you can also dive headlong into mobile development with <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Currently there is no apparent support for Windows Phone, but that is likely going to either come in time, or Microsoft has already made allowances with Bing, a competing search engine.</p>

<p>There is a wide variety of topics to work with in the Google Maps API, and I hope this how-to has piqued your curiosity and helpd remove some of the intimidation factor of the reference materials. There is a lot there, it's dense, and it can be really confusing, but with time and patience, there is a lot of depth and power to be had there.</p>
